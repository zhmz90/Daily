## month 11 / 2015

### 11/27 
    too much ideas to execute so that achived nothing
    First, classification with an emphase on feature selection
    Second, GP tune hyperpara
    Third, PGM / DBM

    1. Learn the structure of COSMIC by PGM
    2. feature selection with random search
### 11/3
    A great idea come in mind.
    chose hyperparameter and do feature selection with Guassian Process
